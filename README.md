Koffing is a automated node.js application that is able to simulate internet traffic by pretending to have people browsing on your network. Make it hard for tracking companies, your ISP or goverment to know who is who on your network!

## Some features

-   Can behave in certain modes like random mode, imitate mode or xxxxxx
-   Works in mulitple languages and browsers
-   Can simulate up to 1000 people at the same time

Imitate mode is very useful because it looks at your DNS request history (if setup correctly) and tries to imitate your network behaviour with ever slightly variations.

> The goal of Koffing is to 'pollute' your
> outgoing network metadata to make it annoying
> for adversaries to go through your data. It is not used
> to hide or anonymize you in anyway!
